## HANGMAN 

Hangman is a classic game where a secret word is displayed and the player has to reveal the word by guessing what letters the word contains. 

To play, select a category between "Countries", "Singers" and "Cities". A secret word missing its letters is then displayed on the screen. For the each of the missing letters, select a letter from the keyboard to fill the position you think it occupies. 
* If correct, the letter is added to every position in the word it appears, and the letter is greyed out from the keyboard and becomes unselectable. 
* If incorrect, the letter selected is displayed on the screen as an incorrect guess and a body part is added to the gallows.

Repeat until the game is won, or until six incorrect guesses where all body parts are added to the gallows and the game is lost.
