# HANGMAN 

Hangman is a classic game where a secret word is displayed and the player has to reveal the word by guessing what letters the word contains. 

To play, select a category between "Countries", "Singers" and "Cities". A secret word missing its letters is then displayed on the screen. For each of the missing letters, select a letter from the keyboard to fill the position you think it occupies. 
* If correct, the letter is added to every position in the word it appears, and the letter is greyed out from the keyboard and becomes unselectable. 
* If incorrect, the letter selected is also greyed out from the keyboard, displayed on the screen as an incorrect guess and a body part is added to the gallows.

After five incorrect guesses, a hint pops up. On the sixth incorrect guess, all body parts are added to the gallows and the game is lost. <br>
The game is won when all letters of the word are guessed.
